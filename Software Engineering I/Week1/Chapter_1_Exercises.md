1. <strong> What is the purpose of modeling?</strong>  

  a.

  <strong>Modeling</strong>

  Modeling is one of the most efficient activities in software development that provides an efficient way to analyze the existing business processes and help in designing new software systems. It reduces the complexity of the problem by removing the irrelevant details from problem and at a time focus only on the relevant details of the question.

  <strong>Purpose of modeling:</strong> There are various purposes of modeling some of them are as follows:

  1. <strong>Better understanding</strong>: The main purpose behind modeling is to understand the complex system in a very easier and efficient way. Complex systems like artificial system that is related with space shuttle, railway ticket reservation system can easily understand with the help of graphical representation.

  2. <strong>Modification in System:</strong> If any modification is required in any system then it becomes very easy and convenient to make any changes in the system.

  3. <strong>Reduce risk:</strong> Modeling reduces the risk in experimenting with models as compared with real scenario. In other words it can be said that it also reduce the cost of modification.

  4. <strong>Decompose:</strong> It decomposes the large complex system into small subsystems. Each of these subsystems can be design and implemented independent of each other. So in this way all the subsystems are developed at the same time in parallel, which speed up the development process.

  5. <strong>Less number of defects:</strong> Modeling helps in evaluation of the system before starting the actual implementation of the system. Hence the final code has the least number of defects.

2. <strong>A programming language is a notation for representing algorithms and data structures. List two advantages and two disadvantages of using a programming language as the sole notation throughout the development process</strong>

  a. <strong>Advantages:</strong> Advantages of using a programming language notation as sole notation for development process are as follows:

  1. <strong>Single notation for all activities:</strong> There is no need to learn different notation technique because only one notation that is programming language notation is used during the whole development process. So it will reduce the burden of learning different notation techniques.

  2. <strong>Traceability:</strong> Same notation is used in all of the development process so it is easier to compare two models. It also helps in predicting the estimate time required to complete the development process.

b. <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Disadvantages of using programming language notation as sole notation for development process are as follow:

1. <strong>Difficulty in representation:</strong> Programming languages have a very poor quality of notation. As a result, it becomes very difficult to represent all of the user requirements by utilizing the programming language notation. If the requirements of the user are not properly represented then there is a possibility that the final manufactured system will differ from the requested system.

2. <strong>Implementation starts earlier:</strong> Due to the programming language notation, programmers starts their implementation at the early state before analyzing the whole model. It also raises the problem where after completing three or four modules a developer may get stuck which may require a lot of modification. If developer starts implementation of the system are analyzing the whole model then their will be less of a chance that the developer will be stuck in implementation.
